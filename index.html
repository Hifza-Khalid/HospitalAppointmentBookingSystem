                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>The Hospital Appointment Booking System is developed to streamline the process of booking, updating,
                    viewing, and canceling appointments in hospitals. It addresses the problems of long queues and
                    mismanagement by allowing patients to book appointments remotely and enabling hospital staff to
                    manage schedules efficiently. The system ensures data accuracy, reduces patient waiting time, and
                    improves overall healthcare service quality.</p>

                <h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
                <p>I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Sir Muneeb Ahmed for his guidance in Z Language for
                    requirement gathering, and to Sir Tayyab Khushi for his support with the Python implementation of
                    the project. I am also grateful to my friends who participated in the Google form for requirement
                    gathering and to the faculty at [Hospital Name] for their cooperation during my visit on April 23,
                    2025, which was crucial for understanding the current hospital system. Lastly, I deeply appreciate
                    the unwavering support and encouragement from my family, which motivated me to successfully complete
                    this project.</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <h3>1.1 The Hospital Appointment Booking System</h3>
                <p>The best way to see how the ideas of formal specification work is through a simple but realistic
                    example. For this purpose, I have chosen a system that is frequently encountered in healthcare
                    settings ‚Äî a Hospital Appointment Booking System. It maintains records of appointments ensuring no
                    double-bookings or unavailable time slots.</p>

                <h4>1.1.1 Basic Types</h4>
                <p>[PATIENT, TIME]</p>

                <h4>1.1.2 State Space</h4>
                <p>The state of the system is described using a Z schema representing current appointment bookings.</p>

                <h4>1.1.3 Invariant Explanation</h4>
                <p>scheduledPatients = dom appointment</p>

                <h4>1.1.4 Example of Appointment State</h4>
                <pre>
scheduledPatients = { Hira, Sana, Zara }
appointment = {
    Hira ‚Ü¶ 10:00AM,
    Sana ‚Ü¶ 03:00PM,
    Zara ‚Ü¶ 06:00PM
}
                </pre>

                <h3>1.2 Operations on the Hospital Appointment Book</h3>

                <h4>1.2.1 Operation: AddAppointment</h4>
                <p>Adds a new appointment if the patient is not already scheduled.</p>

                <h4>1.2.2 Operation: FindAppointment</h4>
                <p>Finds the appointment time for an existing patient without changing the system state.</p>

                <h4>1.2.3 Operation: UpdateAppointment</h4>
                <p>Updates the appointment slot for an existing patient.</p>

                <h4>1.2.4 Operation: ViewAppointments</h4>
                <p>Views the appointment slot for a specific patient.</p>

                <h4>1.2.5 Operation: CancelAppointment</h4>
                <p>Cancels a patient‚Äôs appointment and removes them from the system.</p>

                <h4>1.2.6 Initial State</h4>
                <p>Initially, no patients or appointments are recorded (empty set).</p>

                <h3>1.3 Strengthening the Specification</h3>
                <p>Added an extra output 'result!' for better error handling:<br>REPORT ::= ok | already_scheduled |
                    not_scheduled</p>

                <h4>1.3.1 Success Schema</h4>
                <p>Defines a schema where result! = ok upon successful operations.</p>

                <h4>1.3.2 Robust AddAppointment Operation</h4>
                <p>Details how to add appointments robustly, managing errors and maintaining the invariant.</p>
